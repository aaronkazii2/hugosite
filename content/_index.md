# Aaron Kazi

## Computer Science Major at Northwestern University

Hi, I'm **Aaron Kazi**. I'm a *computer science* student interested in **web development**, *software design*, and building simple tools that make everyday tasks easier.

This site is a small personal project where I can share information about myself and some things I'm working on. It’s built using Hugo, a static site generator that makes it easy to create fast and minimal websites.

## <a id="about"></a>About

I enjoy learning about new frameworks, improving my coding skills, and working on team projects that solve real problems.  
Outside of class, I like experimenting with web apps and exploring different design approaches.

Here’s one of my recent class projects:  
[Campus Marketplace](https://github.com/NU-CS-Software-Studio-Fall-25/project-campus-marketplace?tab=readme-ov-file)

It’s a prototype for a student-to-student marketplace platform that we built in a team for a software studio course.
